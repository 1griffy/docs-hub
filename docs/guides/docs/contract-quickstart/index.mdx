# Smart Contract Quickstart

Getting started with Fuel as a smart contract developer is as simple as:

1. [Installing](#installation) `fuelup`
2. [Generating a counter contract](#generating-a-counter-dapp)
3. [Building and deploying the contract](#running-the-project-locally)

## Generating a counter contract

Run the command below to generate a counter contract in Sway:

```sh
forc template --template-name counter my_counter_project
```

The contract will be in the `src/main.sw` file.

## Building and deploying the contract

To build a contract, you can use:

```sh
forc build
```

To deploy the contract to the testnet, you can run:

```sh
forc deploy --testnet
```

> Note that without the `--testnet` flag, `forc` will attempt to deploy to a local node running at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql`.

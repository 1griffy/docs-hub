# Technical Roadmap

## Testnet Roadmap

Below are the items which will be completed by our testnet.

#### New abi encoding scheme

The new abi encoding scheme will enable support for nested heap types.
This enables developers to return arbitrarily nested heap types from contracts and scripts, and log any arbitrary data type.
A data type allocated on the heap can grow or shrink in size.
Compared to the built-in array and tuple types which are allocated on the stack and cannot grow in serialize.

#### Forkless upgrades in Fuel Core

Supporting forkless upgrades to the fuel core will allow changing logic on the fly for all nodes in the network.
This minimizes the impact to the network when upgrades take place.

#### SRC-20 standardization for bridged assets

#### Fuel wallet connectors

Fuel wallet connectors enable users to sign transactions on the Fuel Network using wallets such as Metamask or Phantom.

#### The Graph integration

Integrating Fuel with The Graph allows developers to easily index and query blockchain data for their Dapps.

## Post-Testnet Roadmap

Below is the item which will be completed after our testnet is launched.

#### Forced transaction inclusion

Forced transaction inclusion allows users to include transactions on Fuel even in the event of a sequencer failure.
This is achieved by sending the transactions to the L1 which includes the transaction in Fuel's block history.

# Understanding UTXO

The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, is a fundamental concept in Fuel's underlying blockchain architecture. Fuel tracks digital currency through transaction outputs, each representing a discrete piece of state that can be spent. This model is extended by stateful UTXOs to include additional data or conditions, enabling complex transactions and smart contract functionalities within a UTXO framework. 

> For example, if Bob wants to send Alice three coins, his wallet utilizes a 10-coin UTXO, sends three coins to Alice, and issues seven coins back to Bob as a new UTXO. This process guarantees that the sum of the inputs equals or exceeds the total outputs, a principle that validators can enforce easily. These newly created output UTXOs can then serve as input UTXOs in subsequent transactions.

## Stateful UTXOs

Fuel has the capability to embed data and logic within UTXOs, enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) on UTXO-based blockchains. This allows UTXOs to carry not just value but also state information and conditions for spending, akin to smart contracts in account-based models.

### Statefulness

These UTXOs can encapsulate not only cryptocurrency but also data and conditions, enabling complex applications and contracts.

### Smart Contract Functionality

Embedded logic within UTXOs allows for actions and state changes, facilitating DApps in a scalable and private manner.

### Transitioning State

Spending an UTXO can update its state or affect others, similar to executing smart contract functions, with new UTXOs representing the updated contract state.

### Enhanced Privacy and Scalability

The encapsulation of state and logic within UTXOs offers privacy benefits and more efficient parallel transaction processing.

## Why Choose UTXO Over Account-Based Models?

Ethereum's account-based model functions similarly to traditional bank accounts, tracking the state of each account by adjusting balances through debits and credits. While Ethereum's model simplifies state management and enables powerful smart contract capabilities, the stateful UTXO model is less state intensive and offers out of the box scalability through the parallelization of transactions. Additionally, UTXO allows for more granular control over transaction outputs and the conditions under which they can be spent.

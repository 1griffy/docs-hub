# Understanding The Bridge

## What is a bridge?

Different blockchain protocols cannot communicate with each other directly without a special mechanism to work together. A bridge is a mechanism that allows just that: bridges allow different blockchains to communicate with each other.

Fuel uses a bridge to connect the Ethereum blockchain with the Fuel blockchain. In the future, Fuel could be connected to a number of different blockchains using bridges.

## Why would someone need a bridge?

Bridges allow users to move assets between different blockchains. For example, if you own ETH on the Ethereum blockchain, you can use a bridge to move it to the Fuel blockchain.

This allows users to take advantage of faster execution and cheaper transactions on the Fuel network using the same assets they already own on another network. It also allows developers to build cross-chain applications that work with assets on multiple blockchains.

## How does the Fuel bridge work?

The Fuel bridge utilizes smart contracts on both the Ethereum and Fuel networks.

Once a bridge is available between two blockchains, assets and data from one network are not automatically available on the other. Users must initiate the bridging process. Fuel provides a convenient [UI](https://app.fuel.network/bridge) to make this process easy for users, but it is possible to use the bridge without a UI as well.

## What types of things can be bridged?

You can bridge anything! The UI currently only supports bridging ETH & ERC-20 tokens, but the underlying bridge architecture can support the bridging of any type of asset or data.

## How does a deposit work?

The process for depositing, or bridging something from Ethereum to Fuel, is slightly different depending on whether or not you are bridging ETH.

For any deposit:

1. A user initiates the deposit on the bridge contract on Ethereum.
2. An event is emitted in the transaction that contains information about the deposit.
3. The transction is confirmed and gets included in a block on Ethereum.
4. A Fuel node (`fuel-core`) picks up the event from the Fuel message portal. If the user is depositing ETH, the node will mint the ETH to the destination wallet on Fuel and the process is complete. If the user is depositing anything besides ETH:
5. The Fuel node will generate a message UTXO and send it to a [predicate](/docs/sway/sway-program-types/predicates/) that validates the correctness of the bridging operation.
6. At this point another transaction is required. Someone must unlock the predicate so that the message UTXO gets sent to `process_message` function. This function mints the final UTXO containing a "mirror" of the asset from Ethereum.
7. The transaction is confirmed and included in a block on Fuel.

You can follow the actual implementation via:

- the `deposit` function in the [`FuelERC20Gateway`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/main/packages/solidity-contracts/contracts/messaging/gateway/FuelERC20Gateway.sol) Solidity contract
- the `sendMessage` function in the [`FuelMessagePortal`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/main/packages/solidity-contracts/contracts/fuelchain/FuelMessagePortal.sol) Solidity contract
(and if the deposit is not ETH:)
- the [Message Predicate](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/main/packages/message-predicates)
- the `process_message` function in the [Bridge Fundible Token](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/main/packages/fungible-token/bridge-fungible-token/src/main.sw) Sway contract

## How does a withdrawl work?

To withdraw, or bridge something from Fuel to Ethereum:

1. A user initiates a withdrawl of anything on the bridge contract on Fuel.
2. In the transaction, the asset/data on the Fuel network is burned, and a message with the withdrawl information is included in the receipts.
3. The transaction is confirmed and included in a block on Fuel.
4. The block is included in an epoch on the Fuel network. An epoch a group of Fuel blocks, packed together and identified by the last block of the epoch.
5. Once the epoch is reached, the last block hash in the epoch is committed to the L1 blockchain in the [Chain State contract](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/main/packages/solidity-contracts/contracts/fuelchain/FuelChainState.sol). This allows anyone to prove the inclusion of all the blocks in the epoch with the Merkle root of the Fuel `rootBlock` (the last block of a Fuel epoch).
6. The transaction is confirmed and included in a block on Ethereum.
7. A grace period must pass before this data is considered finalized and usable to prove the withdrawl was initiated.
8. The user must finalize the withdrawl on the bridge contract on Ethereum by calling the `relayMessage` function with the commmited block and merkle proof data.
This function will then trigger `finalizeWithdrawal` function in the `FuelERC20Gateway` contract on Ethereum with the withdrawl information.
9. Once this final transaction confirmed and included in a block on Ethereum, the assets will be available in the destination wallet.

You can follow the actual implementation via:

- the `withdraw` function in the [Bridge Fundible Token](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/main/packages/fungible-token/bridge-fungible-token/src/main.sw) Sway contract
- the `commit` and `finalized` functions in the [`FuelChainState`](../packages/solidity-contracts/contracts/fuelchain/FuelChainState.sol) Solidity contract
- the `relayMessage` function in the [`FuelMessagePortal`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/main/packages/solidity-contracts/contracts/fuelchain/FuelMessagePortal.sol) Solidity contract
- the `finalizeWithdrawal` function in the [`FuelERC20Gateway`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-bridge/tree/main/packages/solidity-contracts/contracts/messaging/gateway/FuelERC20Gateway.sol) Solidity contract

## How can I use the bridge?

You can try out the Fuel bridge by going to the [bridge UI](https://app.fuel.network/bridge), connecting your wallet, and following the instructions on the page.
You can close the page at any time and check the status of your transaction in the "History" tab of the bridge page.

## Fuel Core
        ### v0.24.2
        ### Version v0.24.2

#### Changed

##### Breaking
- [#1798](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1798): add nonce to relayed transactions and also hash full messages in the inbox root.

#### Fixed

- [#1802](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1802): Fixed a runtime panic that occurred when restarting a node. The panic was caused by an invalid database commit while loading an existing off-chain database. The invalid commit is removed in this PR.
- [#1803](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1803): Produce block when da height haven't changed.
- [#1795](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1795): Fixed the building of the `fuel-core-wasm-executor` to work outside of the `fuel-core` context. The change uses the path to the manifest file of the `fuel-core-upgradable-executor` to build the `fuel-core-wasm-executor` instead of relying on the workspace.

### What's Changed
* Weekly `cargo update` by @github-actions in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1794
* Improvements for the `fuel-core-upgradable-executor` build script by @xgreenx in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1795
* Use full hash for messages in inbox_root and add nonce to relayed transactions by @Voxelot in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1798
* Modify block producer to take into account the total gas used by the L1 transactions by @MitchTurner in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1785
* Fix: Produce block when da height haven't changed by @xgreenx in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1803
* fix: Fix commit error on GraphQL service startup  by @bvrooman in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1802
* Release v0.24.2 by @xgreenx in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1805

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/compare/v0.55.0...v0.56.0

#### Removed unused response method

We've removed response method from `ScriptCallHandler`, `ContractCallHandler` and `MultiContractCallHandler`.


#### Fix encoding capacity overflow bug

- `Configurables` structs must be instantiated through a `::new(encoder_config)` or `::default()` method.
- `Configurables::with_some_string_config(some_string)` methods now return a `Result\<Configurables\>` instead of `Configurables`.
- `Predicates::encode_data` now returns a `Result\<UnresolvedBytes\>` instead of `UnresolvedBytes`.
- `PredicateEncoder` structs must be instantiated through a `::new(encoder_config)` or `::default()`  method.

#### New `decode_as_debug_str` for the `ABIDecoder

You can now decode straight into a debug string:

```Rust
let debug_output =  ABIDecoder::default().decode_as_debug_str(&param_type, &[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 123])?;
```

This was done so users could use `ParamTypes` at runtime to debug logs or return receipts. In addition, users are able to go directly from `ProgramABI` and some data to decoded debug.

BREAKING CHANGE: `EnumVariants` are now imported through `param_types::EnumVariants`

#### Support for `fuel-core` `0.23.0`

- `TxPolicies` `gas_price` is replaced with `tip`.
- `dry_run` now returns `TxStatus`. The receipts can be taken with `tx_status.take_receipts()`.
- `checked_dry_run` is deleted.
- `TransactionResponse`'s `block_id` is replaced with `block_height`.
- `estimate_transaction_cost` has a new argument `block_horizon` used to estimate the gas price.]

# Transaction & Block Models

Fuel's transaction and block models explained.

## Transaction Types

There are three types of transactions:

1. Script transactions
2. Create transactions
3. Mint transactions

### Transaction Validation

All transactions are validated by the FuelVM. Some validation checks only apply to certain types of transactions, while other validation rules are universal.

#### Universal Validation Rules

All transactions must conform to the following rules:

- The transaction type must match one of the supported [transaction types](/docs/fuel-101/transaction-model#transaction-types). 
- All transaction parameters are within the network's [consensus parameters](/docs/specs/tx-format/consensus_parameters).
- There are no invalid inputs or outputs. For example, a  `ChangeOutput` cannot exist for a transaction that does not have an `InputCoin` for the same asset.
- There are no duplicate or competing transaction inputs or outputs. For example, a transaction cannot have two `InputCoin` inputs for the same coin.
- The transction must be able to be serialized and deserialized. 

### Script Transactions

Script transactions are any transaction that 

#### Script Transaction Validation

- The script cannot have an output type of `ContractCreated`.
- The script data cannot be empty.
- The transaction cannot be missing any required policy types.
- The transacation cannot contain any unsupported policy types.

### Create Transactions

`Create` transactions create new contracts on the Fuel network. This is the type of transaction that occurs when you run `forc deploy`.

#### Create Transaction Validation


### Mint Transactions

The `Mint` transaction type is used when new coins are minted.
`Mint` transactions are created by the block producer and are not signed.

#### Mint Transaction Validation

- The `txPointer` must match the block. The value cannot be zero.
- The `inputIndex` of the `outputContract` is not zero.

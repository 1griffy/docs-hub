# Transaction & Block Models

Transactions and blocks on the Fuel network have a unique structure that is optimized for speed and scalability. Below you can find an outline of the structure of transactions and blocks on the Fuel network.

- [Transaction Types](#transaction-types)
- [Transaction Data](#transaction-data)
- [Transaction Validation](#transaction-validation)
- [Block Model](#block-model)

## Transaction Types

There are three types of transactions:

1. Script transactions
2. Create transactions
3. Mint transactions

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/transaction.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="8"
/>

### Script Transactions

Script transactions include all other types of transactions that are not `Create` or `Mint` transactions.

### Create Transactions

`Create` transactions create new contracts on the Fuel network. This is the type of transaction that occurs when you run `forc deploy`.

### Mint Transactions

The `Mint` transaction type is used when new coins are minted as part of a coinbase transaction.
`Mint` transactions are created by the block producer and are not signed.

## Transaction Data

### Transaction Inputs

There are three types of transaction inputs:

1. **Coin** inputs represent funds are are being spent.
2. **Contract** inputs are used when a contract is being called.
3. **Message** inputs are used for messages.

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/input.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="8"
/>

### Transaction Outputs

There are five types of transaction outputs:

1. **Coin** outputs represent ..
2. **Contract** outputs are created when a transaction changes the state of a contract.
3. **Change** outputs are ..
4. **Variable** outputs are used ..
5. **Contract Created** outputs are used when a contract is created.

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/output.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="10"
/>

### Transaction Receipts

The receipts contain all output information for a transaction. For example, if a contract logs a value, the logs will be contained in the receipt.

### Transaction Policies

A transaction must set certain policies in order to be valid. The policies include the gas price, witness limit, maturity, and the maximum fee the sender would allow.

### Transaction Witnesses

A transction must contain the signatures of all parties involved in the transaction. The signatures are stored as witness data in the transaction.

## Transaction Validation

All transactions are validated by the FuelVM. Some validation checks only apply to certain types of transactions, while other validation rules are universal.

### Universal Validation Rules

All transactions must conform to the following rules:

- The transaction type must match one of the supported [transaction types](/docs/fuel-101/transaction-model#transaction-types). 
- All transaction parameters are within the network's [consensus parameters](/docs/specs/tx-format/consensus_parameters).
- There are no invalid inputs or outputs. For example, a  `ChangeOutput` cannot exist for a transaction that does not have an `InputCoin` for the same asset.
- There are no duplicate or competing transaction inputs or outputs. For example, a transaction cannot have two `InputCoin` inputs for the same coin.
- The transction must be able to be serialized and deserialized. 

### Script Transaction Validation

- The script cannot have an output type of `ContractCreated`.
- The script data cannot be empty.
- The transaction cannot be missing any required policy types.
- The transacation cannot contain any unsupported policy types.

### Create Transaction Validation

### Mint Transaction Validation

- The `txPointer` must match the block. The value cannot be zero.
- The `inputIndex` of the `outputContract` is not zero.

## Block Model

Block objects are wrapped in a Conensus object that is specific to a network. The Block header itself is network agnostic.

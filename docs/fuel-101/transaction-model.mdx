# Transaction and Block Models

Transactions and blocks on the Fuel network have a unique structure that is optimized for speed and scalability. Below you can find an outline of the structure of transactions and blocks on the Fuel network.

- [Transaction Types](#what-are-the-different-types-of-transactions)
- [Transaction Data](#what-data-is-included-in-a-transaction)
- [Transaction Validation](#how-are-transactions-validated)
- [Block Model](#what-does-the-fuel-block-model-look-like)

## What are the different types of transactions?

There are five types of transactions:

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/transaction.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="10"
/>

1. **Script Transactions** are transactions that require some type of execution and don't hold internal state.
2. **Create Transactions** create new contracts on the Fuel network. This is the type of transaction that occurs when you run `forc deploy`.
3. **Mint Transactions** are used when new coins are minted as part of a coinbase transaction. `Mint` transactions are created by the block producer and are not signed.
4. **Upgrade Transactions** are used to upgrade the network.
5. **Upload Transactions** are used to upload chunks of state transition bytecode before network upgrades.

## What data is included in a transaction?

{/*TODO: add link to UTXO page*/}
Transactions on the Fuel network utilize a UTXO model.
There are several types of data contained in a transaction:

- [Transaction Policies](#transaction-policies)
- [Transaction Witnesses](#transaction-witnesses)
- [Transaction Inputs](#transaction-inputs)
- [Transaction Outputs](#transaction-outputs)
- [Transaction Receipts](#transaction-receipts)

### Transaction Policies

A transaction must set certain [policies](/docs/specs/tx-format/policy/) in order to be valid.

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/policy.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="10"
/>

The policies include:
- The [**tip**](/docs/specs/tx-format/policy#tip) amount, which is the amount of the base asset tipped to the block producer.
- The [**witness limit**](/docs/specs/tx-format/policy#witnesslimit), or the maximum amount of witnesses allowed for the transaction.
- The [**maturity**](/docs/specs/tx-format/policy#maturity), which is the earliest block that the transaction can be included in.
- The [**maximum fee**](/docs/specs/tx-format/policy#maxfee) allowed. This amount includes the tip amount.

### Transaction Witnesses

A transaction must contain the signatures of all parties involved in the transaction. Signatures are a type of witness data. Witness data is malleable, which means that it is not included in the transaction hash calculation.

### Transaction Inputs

There are three parent types of transaction inputs:

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/input.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="8"
/>

1. [**Coin**](/docs/graphql/reference/objects#inputcoin) inputs represent funds that are being spent.
2. [**Contract**](/docs/graphql/reference/objects#inputcontract) inputs are used when a contract is being called.
3. [**Message**](/docs/graphql/reference/objects#inputmessage) inputs are used for messages.

### Transaction Outputs

There are five types of transaction outputs:

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/output.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="10"
/>

1. [**Coin**](/docs/graphql/reference/objects#coinoutput) outputs represent a transfer of an asset. This type of output is only used when a transaction does not have any malleable fields. This means that the recipient, asset, and amount is known before the transaction is fully executed.
2. [**Contract**](/docs/graphql/reference/objects#contractoutput) outputs are created when a transaction changes the state of a contract.
3. [**Change**](/docs/graphql/reference/objects#changeoutput) outputs are similar to coin outputs, but are used when the amount is not known.
4. [**Variable**](/docs/graphql/reference/objects#variableoutput) outputs are similar to coin outputs, but the recipient, asset, and amount are not known before the transaction is fully executed.
5. [**Contract Created**](/docs/graphql/reference/objects#contractcreated) outputs are used when a contract is deployed.

### Transaction Receipts

After a transaction is executed, a list of [receipts](/docs/specs/abi/receipts/) that contain all of the output information is generated. For example, if a contract logs a value, or panics during execution, this information will be contained in the receipts list. The merkle root of the receipts list is stored in the transaction.

### Transaction Pointer

The [transaction pointer](/docs/specs/tx-format/tx-pointer/) is a unique identifier that is used to reference the location of a transaction within a block.

## How are transactions validated?

All transactions are [validated](/docs/specs/protocol/tx-validity/) by the FuelVM. Some validation checks only apply to certain types of transactions, while other validation rules are universal.

### Universal Validation Rules

All transactions must conform to the following rules:

- The transaction type must match one of the supported [transaction types](#what-are-the-different-types-of-transactions).
- All transaction parameters are within the network's [consensus parameters](/docs/specs/tx-format/consensus_parameters).
- There are no invalid inputs or outputs. For example, a `ChangeOutput` cannot exist for a transaction that does not have an `InputCoin` for the same asset.
- There are no duplicate or competing transaction inputs or outputs. For example, a transaction cannot have two `InputCoin` inputs for the same coin.
- The transaction's maximum fee must be enough to cover the execution cost.

### Transaction-Specific Validation

In addition to the universal validation rules above, each transaction type has its own set of validation rules.

#### Script Transaction Validation

- The script cannot have an output type of `ContractCreated`.
- The script data cannot be empty.
- The transaction cannot be missing any required policy types.
- The transacation cannot contain any unsupported policy types.
- Predicates must pass [predicate verification](/docs/specs/fuel-vm#predicate-verification).

#### Create Transaction Validation

- The transaction cannot perform any other operations besides creating a contract. This includes sending a message, interacting with another contract, sending any assets, etc.
- The transaction must have exactly one `ContractCreated` output.
- The keys of `storageSlots` must be in ascending lexicographic order. (who does this ordering?)
- The contract ID must not already be in use. The Sparse Merkle tree root of the `storageSlots` is not equal to the `stateRoot` of a deployed contract.
- The transaction cannot be missing any required policy types.
- The transacation cannot contain any unsupported policy types.

#### Mint Transaction Validation

- The `txPointer` must match the block. The value cannot be zero.
- The `inputIndex` of the `outputContract` is not zero.

## What does the Fuel block model look like?

Blocks on the Fuel network contain 4 main components:

1. [**Block ID**](/docs/graphql/reference/scalars#blockid) - A unique identifier for the block.
2. [**Header**](/docs/specs/protocol/block-header/) - Contains metadata about the block, such as the block height, the time the block was created, and the previous block's root.
3. [**Consensus**](/docs/graphql/reference/unions#consensus) - Contains network-specific consensus data.
4. [**Transactions**](/docs/graphql/reference/objects#transaction) - A list of transactions that are included in the block.

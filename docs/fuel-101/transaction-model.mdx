# Transaction & Block Models

Transactions and blocks on the Fuel network have a unique structure that is optimized for speed and scalability. Below you can find an outline of the structure of transactions and blocks on the Fuel network.

- [Transaction Types](#transaction-types)
- [Transaction Data](#transaction-data)
- [Transaction Validation](#transaction-validation)
- [Block Model](#block-model)

## Transaction Types

There are three types of transactions:

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/transaction.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="8"
/>

1. **Script Transactions** include all other types of transactions that are not `Create` or `Mint` transactions.
2. **Create Transactions** create new contracts on the Fuel network. This is the type of transaction that occurs when you run `forc deploy`.
3. **Mint Transactions** are used when new coins are minted as part of a coinbase transaction. `Mint` transactions are created by the block producer and are not signed.

## Transaction Data

There are several types of data contained in a transaction on the Fuel network:

- [Transaction Policies](#transaction-policies)
- [Transaction Witnesses](#transaction-witnesses)
- [Transaction Inputs](#transaction-inputs)
- [Transaction Outputs](#transaction-outputs)
- [Transaction Receipts](#transaction-receipts)

### Transaction Policies

A transaction must set certain policies in order to be valid. The policies include the gas price, witness limit, maturity, and the maximum fee allowed.

### Transaction Witnesses

A transction must contain the signatures of all parties involved in the transaction, A.K.A. the transaction "witnesses". The signatures are stored as witness data.

### Transaction Inputs

There are three types of transaction inputs:

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/input.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="8"
/>

1. **Coin** inputs represent funds are are being spent.
2. **Contract** inputs are used when a contract is being called.
3. **Message** inputs are used for messages.

### Transaction Outputs

There are five types of transaction outputs:

<CodeImport
  file="../fuel-specs/src/tx-format/output.md"
  lang="rust"
  lineStart="4"
  lineEnd="10"
/>

1. **Coin** outputs represent a transfer of an asset. This type of output is only used when a transaction does not have any malleable fields. This means that the recipient, asset, and amount is known before the transaction is fully executed.
2. **Contract** outputs are created when a transaction changes the state of a contract.
3. **Change** outputs are similar to coin outputs, but are used when the amount is not known.
4. **Variable** outputs are similar to coin outputs, but the recipient, asset, and amount are not known before the transaction is fully executed.
5. **Contract Created** outputs are used when a contract is created.

### Transaction Receipts

After a transaction is executed, a list of receipts that contain all of the output information is generated. For example, if a contract logs a value, or panics during execution, this information will be contained in the receipts list.

### Transaction Pointer

Once a transaction is included in a block, it is assigned a transaction pointer. The transaction pointer is a unique identifier that is used to reference the location of the transaction in the block.

## Transaction Validation

All transactions are validated by the FuelVM. Some validation checks only apply to certain types of transactions, while other validation rules are universal.

### Universal Validation Rules

All transactions must conform to the following rules:

- The transaction type must match one of the supported [transaction types](/docs/fuel-101/transaction-model#transaction-types).
- All transaction parameters are within the network's [consensus parameters](/docs/specs/tx-format/consensus_parameters).
- There are no invalid inputs or outputs. For example, a  `ChangeOutput` cannot exist for a transaction that does not have an `InputCoin` for the same asset.
- There are no duplicate or competing transaction inputs or outputs. For example, a transaction cannot have two `InputCoin` inputs for the same coin.
- The transction must be able to be serialized and deserialized.

### Transaction-Specific Validation

In addition to the universal validation rules above, each transaction type has its own set of validation rules.

#### Script Transaction Validation

- The script cannot have an output type of `ContractCreated`.
- The script data cannot be empty.
- The transaction cannot be missing any required policy types.
- The transacation cannot contain any unsupported policy types.

#### Create Transaction Validation

- The transaction cannot perform any other operations besides creating a contract. This includes sending a message, interacting with another contract, sending any assets, etc.
- The transaction must have exactly one `ContractCreated` output.
- The keys of storageSlots must be in ascending lexicographic order.
- The contract ID must not already be in use.
- The Sparse Merkle tree root of the `storageSlots` is not equal to the `stateRoot` of a deployed contract.
- The transaction cannot be missing any required policy types.
- The transacation cannot contain any unsupported policy types.

#### Mint Transaction Validation

- The `txPointer` must match the block. The value cannot be zero.
- The `inputIndex` of the `outputContract` is not zero.

## Block Model

Block objects are wrapped in a Conensus object that is specific to a network. The Block header itself is network agnostic.

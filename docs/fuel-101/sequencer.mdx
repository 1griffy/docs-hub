# What is a Sequencer?

> A sequencer is a component utilized in Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and certain types of Zero-Knowledge Rollups to order transactions.

Since rollups strategically leverage the consensus and data availability of another layer 1 chain, they depend on a sequencer for transaction ordering.

By efficiently ordering transactions, sequencers allow Layer 2 solutions to significantly reduce transaction processing times and costs. This efficiency gain is essential for scaling blockchain networks and improving their usability for a wider range of applications, making the trade-off an integral part of optimizing blockchain performance.

## Shared Sequencer

> A shared sequencer model involves multiple entities or nodes taking turns or sharing the responsibility of sequencing transactions.

Fuel leverages a shared sequencer an Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI), integrated with the Cosmos network. Validators participating in this shared sequencer network stake Fuel tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. They are responsible for 

1. Establishing the order of Fuel's blocks
2. Verifying these optimistically ordered blocks through fraud proofing

Any misbehaving actors producing bad blocks within the system are penalized (slashed) on Ethereum. The sequencer network uses the `secp256k1` cryptographic algorithm, which is compatible with Ethereum's infrastructure.

### 1. Transaction Batching

The shared sequencer network to collect a large number of transactions over a certain period. Instead of each transaction being submitted individually to the base chain, the sequencer batches these transactions into a single package. This approach significantly reduces the number of transactions that the base chain has to process, as a single batched transaction on the base chain can represent hundreds or thousands of individual transactions.

### 2. Off-Chain Computation

Shared sequencers perform much of the computational work off-chain. This includes executing the transactions in the batch, computing the new state, and only then submitting the relevant data to the base chain. Since the computational work is done off-chain, the base chain does not need to expend resources on executing these transactions, which reduces its workload and the amount of data it needs to process and store.

### 3. Data Compression

Before submitting transactions to the base chain, sequencers employs various data compression techniques to reduce the size of the transaction data. This involves encoding the data in a more efficient format and uses cryptographic techniques to represent the data more compactly.

### 4. Fraud Proofs

Fuel is an optimistic rollup, meaning its shared sequencer network submits a summary of transactions along with a commitment to the new state. Transactions are presumed valid by default, but there is a [dynamic challenge period](https://forum.fuel.network/t/why-wait-a-week-fast-finality-optimistic-rollups/4471) during which fraudulent transactions can be disputed. This significantly reduces the finality time of transactions from 7 days to just a few blocks. The Merkle root generated can serve as evidence of transaction order for a fraud-proof system. All sequencer network block headers are posted back to Ethereum for transparency and security.

## Why Shared Sequencer?

**Reduced Centralization**: Distributing the sequencing responsibilities across multiple participants diminishes the risk of centralization and censorship, fostering a more decentralized network.

**Increased Security**: By sharing the sequencing duties, it becomes more challenging for any single party to manipulate the sequencing process. This collective approach significantly bolsters the network's security.

# Modular Design

## Abstract

__Modular Design__ in _Blockchains_ and _Distributed Ledgers_ aims to solve scalability issues, often described as the _"Blockchain Trilemma"_, by splitting into independent modules focused on specific tasks such as: Consensus, Execution, Data Availability, and Settlement. By doing so, _Modular Blockchains_ are able to achieve higher performance while maintaining security and flexibility. In this context, Fuel presents itself as a top-of-the-line Execution layer specialized in parallel and state-minimized execution.

## Monolithic blockchains and the trilemma

## Rollups, Validiums and Sovereign Rollups

## Optimistic and ZK proving

## The roll up os

## Layer 3 and beyond

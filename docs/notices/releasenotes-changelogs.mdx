## Breaking changes

### Removed `NetworkInfo`

- Removed `NetworkInfo` and all related functions/methods
- Renamed `DryRunner` trait and added trait methods
- Removed `ScritpTransactionBuilder::new` and `CreateTransactionBuilder::new`
- Removed `Provider::new`

### Use `submit_and_await_commit` API

`send_transaction_and_await_commit` function now returns a `TxStatus` instead of `TxId`.

### Signing and the `Signer` trait

- Removed `sign_message` and `sign_transaction` from the `Signer` trait
- Added `sign` and `address` methods to the `Signer` trait
- `Signer` trait moved do `fuels::core::traits:::Signer`
- `Message`, `PublicKey`, `SecretKey` and `Signature` moved to `fuels::crypto::`
- Replaced `Transaction`'s `check_without_signatures` with `check`
- Renamed `Account`s `add_witnessses` to `add_witnesses`
- Removed `Clone` for `TransactionBuilder`s

### Conversion from `Address`/`ContractId` types to `Identity`

It's not a breaking change, just a new cool UX feature. Convert from `Address`/`Bech32Address`/`ContractId`/`Bech32ContractId` to `Identity` easily.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs/compare/v0.55.0...v0.56.0

### Removed unused response method

We've removed response method from `ScriptCallHandler`, `ContractCallHandler` and `MultiContractCallHandler`.

### Fix encoding capacity overflow bug

- `Configurables` structs must be instantiated through a `::new(encoder_config)` or `::default()` method.
- `Configurables::with_some_string_config(some_string)` methods now return a `Result\<Configurables\>` instead of `Configurables`.
- `Predicates::encode_data` now returns a `Result\<UnresolvedBytes\>` instead of `UnresolvedBytes`.
- `PredicateEncoder` structs must be instantiated through a `::new(encoder_config)` or `::default()`  method.

### New `decode_as_debug_str` for the `ABIDecoder

You can now decode straight into a debug string:

```Rust
let debug_output =  ABIDecoder::default().decode_as_debug_str(&param_type, &[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 123])?;
```

This was done so users could use `ParamTypes` at runtime to debug logs or return receipts. In addition, users are able to go directly from `ProgramABI` and some data to decoded debug.

BREAKING CHANGE: `EnumVariants` are now imported through `param_types::EnumVariants`

### Support for `fuel-core` `0.23.0`

- `TxPolicies` `gas_price` is replaced with `tip`.
- `dry_run` now returns `TxStatus`. The receipts can be taken with `tx_status.take_receipts()`.
- `checked_dry_run` is deleted.
- `TransactionResponse`'s `block_id` is replaced with `block_height`.
- `estimate_transaction_cost` has a new argument `block_horizon` used to estimate the gas price.
